**Abstract:**  
Generating coherent, narratively structured, and factually accurate scripts for long-form videos remains a critical yet underexplored challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as existing benchmarks—focused on short clips or limited contextual evaluation—fail to assess the key capabilities required for this task, such as synthesizing global storylines, maintaining cross-scene consistency, and retaining fine-grained details. To address this gap, we introduce **LVSG-Bench**, a comprehensive benchmark for benchmarking MLLMs’ **Long-form Video Script Generation** capabilities, comprising 200 narrative-rich videos across six diverse domains and a dual-dimension evaluation protocol that assesses both scene-level narrative coherence and event-level factual accuracy. We also present an automated pipeline for generating a high-quality training corpus, with experiments showing that fine-tuning MLLMs on just 7,000 curated samples from this pipeline yields substantial gains in script quality, especially for long videos. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform long-form video script generation. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.
